## Implementation Checklist (Derived from Official Sources)

### Steps to Build the Skill

**1. Create skill folder structure:**
```
.skills/readme-to-ai-reference/
├── SKILL.md                 # Main skill definition (required)
├── README.md                # Optional: human-friendly overview
└── examples/                # Optional: example outputs
```

**2. Create SKILL.md with required components:**
- YAML frontmatter specifying name, description, version
- Objective: Clear, single-purpose statement
- Inputs: Expected input format and constraints
- Outputs: Artifact types and formats
- Workflow: Step-by-step transformation process
- Quality gates: Validation rules before finalization

**3. Define output artifacts:**
- `ai/AI_INDEX.md` — Machine-readable index with anchors
- `ai/architecture.md` — Structural organization with TOC
- `ai/file_index.md` — File catalog with relationships
- `ai/settings_schema.yaml` — Structured metadata schema
- `ai/glossary.md` — Term definitions with backlinks
- `ai/capabilities_map.md` — Feature matrix (if applicable)

**4. Implement stable anchors:**
```markdown
<!-- DOC:ARCH:DELEGATE_LIFECYCLE -->
<!-- DOC:SCHEMA:ENTITIES -->
<!-- DOC:GLOSSARY:ATTRIBNAME -->
```
These enable reliable cross-referencing and prevent link rot.

**5. Enforce non-hallucination constraint:**
- "Do not invent file paths, constants, or functions."
- Validate against source README before each output
- Log all inferred vs. explicitly stated content
- Fail gracefully on ambiguous requirements

## Output Format Specification

### Markdown Output Files

**File: AI_INDEX.md**  
Purpose: Machine-readable entry point  
- Anchored sections for each logical domain
- Hierarchical heading structure (H1 → H6)
- Backtick-wrapped syntax elements
- Consistent code block language tags

**File: architecture.md**  
Purpose: Structural relationships  
- ASCII diagrams (if complex) or textual descriptions
- Clear layer/component boundaries
- Data flow indicators
- Integration points

**File: file_index.md**  
Purpose: File-level navigation  
- Table with columns: Filename | Purpose | Type | Key Exports
- Consistent path notation (relative from repo root)
- Language/format indicators

**File: glossary.md**  
Purpose: Term resolution  
- Alphabetical ordering
- One term per H3 heading
- Example usage where applicable
- Links to related terms

### YAML Output Files

**File: settings_schema.yaml**  
Purpose: Structured configuration reference  
- Valid YAML 1.2 syntax
- Type annotations for each field
- Default values where applicable
- Hierarchical property nesting

---

## Quality Assurance Criteria

### Before Skill Deployment

- [ ] SKILL.md frontmatter contains: name, description, version, author
- [ ] All output files exist and validate (Markdown lint, YAML lint)
- [ ] Anchors are unique and stable across regenerations
- [ ] No invented paths or undefined constants in outputs
- [ ] Example invocations execute successfully
- [ ] Outputs pass accessibility checks (alt text, link validation)
- [ ] Total file size reasonable for context windows

### During Skill Invocation

- [ ] Source README is fully parsed before transformation begins
- [ ] Ambiguities flagged and logged (not silently resolved)
- [ ] Outputs validated against constraints before return
- [ ] User receives clear error messages on failure
- [ ] Partial results documented (if timeout occurs)

## Source Citation Rules

When using this documentation:

1. **Always cite which source governs each implementation decision**
   - Example: "Per GitHub Docs (Creating Agent Skills), SKILL.md frontmatter must include..."

2. **Prefer official GitHub Docs over blog posts**
   - Instance: Use https://docs.github.com/ as primary reference
   - Blog posts serve as behavioral explanation, not normative spec

3. **Treat blog posts as behavioral explanation, not requirements**
   - Changelogs: Confirm feature availability
   - Blog articles: Illustrate use cases and best practices
   - Official docs: Define requirements and constraints

4. **Link to stable GitHub Docs URLs**
   - Format: `https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/[path]`
   - Avoid short links that may redirect

5. **Document version assumptions**
   - Copilot SKill format: Latest (as of 2026-03)
   - Markdown: GitHub-flavored
   - YAML: Version 1.2
