# Phase 4 — System-Level Consolidation

> **Trigger:** User explicitly says "Phase 4" or "regenerate system indexes"
>
> **Usage:** Paste this entire file into a fresh Copilot Chat session, or invoke by trigger phrase. Copilot will read the existing Phase 3 summaries from disk and produce the 6 system index files + master index.

---

## ROLE

You are a technical documentation consolidator for the Age of Empires IV SCAR scripting reference project.

## TASK

Create 7 cross-cutting reference files by synthesizing data **exclusively** from the existing Phase 3 summary files. Work through the system files one at a time in the order listed below.

## HARD CONSTRAINTS

1. **ONLY read files from these two directories** (and their subdirectories):
   - `reference/campaigns/` (65 mission summary .md files)
   - `reference/gameplay/` (11 gameplay system .md files)
2. **NEVER open, read, or reference:**
   - Raw `.scar` source files (anywhere under `scenarios/`)
   - Batch files (`reference/dumps/Claude_Batches_v2/`)
   - Phase 1 CSV indexes (`reference/*.csv`) — unless explicitly told to cross-reference
   - Any file outside the two directories above
3. **Do not re-summarize** the input files. Extract and reorganize specific data points only.
4. **Output location:** All files go in `reference/systems/` (create the file directly, don't just show the content).
5. **If a summary file lacks data for a given system** (e.g., no difficulty table), skip it silently. Do not hallucinate data.
6. **Preserve exact constant names** — copy `OBJ_TakeVillage`, `SOBJ_BuildWalls`, etc. verbatim. Do not rename or normalize them.

---

## EXECUTION ORDER

Process these **sequentially**, one at a time. For each system file:
1. Read all relevant summary files (use subagents to read in parallel where possible)
2. Extract the targeted data
3. Write the output file
4. Confirm completion before moving to the next

---

## SYSTEM FILE 1: `reference/systems/objectives-index.md`

### Input
All 65 files in `reference/campaigns/` (all subdirectories).

### What to Extract
From each mission summary's **KEY SYSTEMS → Objectives** section:
- Every objective constant (OBJ_, SOBJ_, TOBJ_, or dot-path like `_challenge.victory.*`)
- Its type (OT_Primary, OT_Secondary, OT_Bonus, OT_Battle, OT_Information)
- Its phase (if a Phase column exists)
- Its purpose (one-line description)
- Win/Lose conditions (from prose below the objectives table)

### Output Format
```markdown
# Objectives Index

Cross-reference of all objectives across campaign missions, extracted from Phase 3 summaries.

## Summary Statistics
- Total objectives: [count]
- By type: Primary [n], Secondary [n], Bonus [n], Battle [n], Information [n]

## By Campaign

### Abbasid Dynasty
#### abb_m1_tyre
| Constant | Type | Phase | Purpose |
|----------|------|-------|---------|
| OBJ_... | OT_Primary | — | ... |

**Win condition:** [from prose]
**Lose condition:** [from prose]

[repeat for each mission]

## Shared Patterns
- List any objective constants that appear in multiple missions
- Note naming conventions (OBJ_ vs SOBJ_ vs dot-path in challenges)
- Common objective chaining patterns (Phase 1 complete → starts Phase 2, etc.)
```

---

## SYSTEM FILE 2: `reference/systems/difficulty-index.md`

### Input
All 65 files in `reference/campaigns/`. Also read `reference/gameplay/missionomatic.md` for the Util_DifVar API description.

### What to Extract
From each mission summary's **KEY SYSTEMS → Difficulty** section:
- Every `Util_DifVar` parameter row (Parameter name, Easy/Standard/Hard/Expert values, description)
- Medal tier tables (from challenges that use those instead of `Util_DifVar`)
- Any difficulty-conditional logic mentioned in prose ("Hard/Expert only", etc.)

### Output Format
```markdown
# Difficulty Index

Consolidation of all difficulty-scaling parameters across missions.

## API Reference
Brief description of `Util_DifVar(value, {easy, standard, hard, expert})` from gameplay/missionomatic.md.

## By Campaign

### Abbasid Dynasty
#### abb_m1_tyre
| Parameter | Easy | Standard | Hard | Expert | Scales |
|-----------|------|----------|------|--------|--------|

[repeat for each mission]

### Challenges (Medal Tiers)
#### challenge_basiccombat
| Medal | Threshold (PC) | Threshold (Xbox) |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Gold | ... | ... |

## Cross-Mission Comparison
- Parameters that appear across multiple missions (e.g., spawn delays, army sizes)
- Scaling ranges (most generous → most punishing)
- Common scaling categories: spawn timing, unit counts, health multipliers, resource rates
```

---

### Input
All 65 files in `reference/campaigns/`. Also read `reference/gameplay/ai.md` (WaveGenerator section) and `reference/gameplay/missionomatic.md` (Wave System section).

### What to Extract
From each mission summary's **KEY SYSTEMS → Spawns** section:
- Spawn wave definitions (source, composition, timing, difficulty scaling)
- Static defender placements
- Reinforcement mechanics
- Army module compositions
- Named spawn functions (reusable patterns)

### Output Format
```markdown
# Spawns & Wave Patterns Index

## System Reference
Brief summary of WaveGenerator and MissionOMatic Wave System from gameplay summaries.

## EXECUTION GUIDANCE

### Reading Strategy
- The 65 campaign summaries total ~1.16 MB. You cannot read them all at once.
- Use subagents to read files in parallel batches (e.g., one subagent per campaign folder).
- For each system file, read only the relevant sections from each summary (e.g., for objectives-index.md, focus on the "Objectives" subsection in each file).
- Read the gameplay system files directly — they're small enough (~20 KB each).

### Progress Tracking
- Use the todo list tool to track which system files are complete.
- Confirm each file is written to disk before proceeding to the next.
- If a system file would exceed reasonable length (>500 lines), prioritize structured tables over prose.

### Quality Checks
- Every mission mentioned in a campaign folder should appear in the relevant system file.
- Cross-reference mission counts: abbasid(9), angevin(11), challenges(13), hundred(8), mongol(9), rogue(1), russia(8), salisbury(6) = 65 total.
- Gameplay files: ai.md, core.md, gamemodes.md, gameplay.md, missionomatic.md, prefabs_replay.md, rogue.md, startconditions.md, training.md, ui.md, winconditions.md = 11 total.
