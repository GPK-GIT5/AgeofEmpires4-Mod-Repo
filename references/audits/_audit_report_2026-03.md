# Reference Folder Audit Report
**Date:** March 2, 2026 | **Updated:** March 2026 (Phase 1–6 remediation) | **Scope:** reference/ directory | **Status:** Partially Resolved

---

## Executive Summary

✅ ~~CRITICAL: 4 broken links to mod reference documents~~ — **RESOLVED** (Phase 1, root INDEX.md links fixed)  
⚠️ **STRUCTURAL:** Duplicate/confusing Mods sections create navigation ambiguity (open)  
📊 **METADATA:** Date mismatch in INDEX.md (open — cosmetic)  
💾 **AI-READINESS:** Two oversized CSV files (1.4–1.9 MB) will consume excessive tokens (open)  
✅ **METRICS:** Function/global/group counts verified consistent across documents  

### Remediation Log (March 2026)

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Root INDEX.md: fixed ~20 broken relative links, removed ghost `dumps/`, added `ui/`, `audits/`, `ai_sessions/` to subdirectories | ✅ Done |
| 2 | navigation/INDEX.md: added `ui/`, `audits/`, `ai_sessions/` to subdirectories, updated file count | ✅ Done |
| 3 | copilot-instructions.md + scar-specialist.agent.md: added `references/ui/` to Sources of Truth and Key References | ✅ Done |
| 4 | ai_sessions/: normalized SESSION_ID format, created README.md | ✅ Done |
| 5 | This audit report: marked resolved items, added remediation log | ✅ Done |
| 6 | master-index.md: fixed Japan link path, added ui/ entries | ✅ Done |

### New Findings (March 2026)

- **ui/ folder** (`references/ui/`) existed on disk with 3 files but was invisible to all indexes and retrieval paths — now indexed
- **audits/ folder** (`references/audits/`) was not referenced in any navigation index — now indexed
- **ai_sessions/ folder** (`references/ai_sessions/`) had no README, inconsistent SESSION_ID format — now normalized
- **master-index.md** has ~100+ relative links that assume `references/` root context but the file lives in `references/navigation/` — systemic path issue noted for future fix

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. Broken Links to Mod Reference Files

**Severity:** HIGH — Links are unusable and violate "use reference copy" policy

| File | Line | Current Link | Actual Path | Impact |
|------|------|--------------|------------|--------|
| [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) | 67 | `mods/japan-stage1-summary.md` | `mods/japan_reference/japan-stage1-summary.md` | Dead link |
| [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) | 68 | `mods/japan-stage2-summary.md` | `mods/japan_reference/japan-stage2-summary.md` | Dead link |
| [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) | 116 | `mods/japan-stage1-summary.md` | `mods/japan_reference/japan-stage1-summary.md` | Dead link (duplicate) |
| [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) | 117 | `mods/japan-stage2-summary.md` | `mods/japan_reference/japan-stage2-summary.md` | Dead link (duplicate) |
| [master-index.md](master-index.md) | ~169 | `mods/japan-stage1-summary.md` | `mods/japan_reference/japan-stage1-summary.md` | Dead link |

**All broken links point to:** Files moved into `japan_reference/` subdirectory but links not updated.

**Verification:** All files do exist at the correct location:
- ✓ `reference/mods/japan_reference/japan-stage1-summary.md` (exists)
- ✓ `reference/mods/japan_reference/japan-stage2-summary.md` (exists)

---

### 2. Metadata Timestamp Conflict

**Severity:** HIGH — Undermines data freshness confidence

**Finding:**
```
INDEX.md header (line 5):        "Last Updated: February 24, 2026"
INDEX.md statistics (line 130):  "Last updated: February 23, 2026"
data-index.md header (line 3):   "Auto-generated on 2026-02-23 19:40"
```

**Impact:** 1-day discrepancy suggests INDEX.md header was manually updated after statistics section was auto-generated, creating ambiguity about which is authoritative.

**Observation:** All metrics (8,989 functions, 14,158 globals, 3,214 groups) are synchronized, suggesting *data* is current but metadata labeling is inconsistent.

---

## Structural Issues (Should Fix)

### 3. Duplicate/Redundant Mods Sections

**Severity:** MEDIUM — Creates navigation confusion and code duplication

**Finding:**
Two separate sections exist in [INDEX.md](INDEX.md):

**Section 1: Lines 63–70 ("## 🧭 Mods")**
- Lists 2 files (both with broken links now)
- No guidance on when to use these

**Section 2: Lines 106–122 ("## 🎯 Mod-Specific Resources")**
- Lists 6 files (full Japan scenario reference copies)
- Explicitly states policy: "Always use reference copy (`reference/mods/MOD-INDEX.md`)"
- 2 files still have broken links

**Impact:**
- Users may read Section 1 (less detail) instead of Section 2 (complete guidance)
- Policy enforcement text is in Section 2, making it less discoverable
- Broken links appear in BOTH sections, compounding the problem

**Recommendation:** Consolidate into one authoritative Mods section with policy statement at the top.

---

### 4. Missing "Authority Markers" on Key Reference Files

**Severity:** MEDIUM — AI consumers can't verify freshness or scope of data

**Files without metadata (title + last-updated + scope):**

| File | Size | Lines | Metadata Status | Impact |
|------|------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| [scar-api-functions.md](scar-api-functions.md) | 348 | 348 | Only title | Unclear if SCAR API is complete or filtered |
| [commands-reference.md](commands-reference.md) | 341 | 341 | Only title | Unclear coverage scope (all command types?) |
| [constants-and-enums.md](constants-and-enums.md) | 512 | 512 | Only title+description | No generation date; stale risk |
| [aoe4world-data-index.md](aoe4world-data-index.md) | 312 | 312 | Only title+description | No freshness indicator |

**Files WITH metadata (good examples):**
- [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) — Has: Last Updated date + Coverage metrics ✓
- [data-index.md](data-index.md) — Has: Auto-generated timestamp + summary stats ✓
- [extraction-workflow.md](extraction-workflow.md) — Has: Description of pipeline ✓

**Impact:** Copilot and users cannot quickly verify if these are current or stale. Recommend adding:
```
Last Updated: [DATE] | Coverage: [SCOPE] | Source: [GENERATION METHOD]
```

---

## Informational Notes (Nice to Improve)

### 5. CSV File Size for AI Consumption

**Files:**
- `globals-index.csv` — 1.85 MB (14,159 rows)
- `function-index.csv` — 1.40 MB (8,990 rows)

**Observation:** Both CSV files exceed 1 MB, which means they consume ~30–40K tokens when fed to Copilot in a single call. This forces users to either:
1. Load the entire file (expensive token overhead)
2. Use grep/filtering externally first (friction)
3. Rely on `.md` companion files (which are smaller)

**Note:** This is *not* a blocker (files are machine-readable and documented), but suggests a future optimization opportunity:
- Split by category (e.g., `function-index-squad.csv`, `function-index-entity.csv`)
- Or: Generate category-specific extracts on-demand via scripts

**Current mitigation:** The accompanying `.md` companion files (function-index.md, data-index.md) provide narrative entry points that are more Copilot-friendly.

---

### 6. Entry Point & Navigation Clarity

**Strength:** [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) is correctly designated as the entry point.

**Minor observations:**
- INDEX.md → master-index.md chain is clear ✓
- Task-based navigation ("I need to call SCAR functions") is well-structured ✓
- Subdirectories are linked and described ✓

**One source of confusion:** The presence of *two* mod sections makes it unclear whether users should look at Section 1 or Section 2 for Japan scenario work. Section 2 ("Mod-Specific Resources") provides the complete policy statement, but Section 1 appears first.

## Appendix: Broken Links List

### All Broken Links (Exact Targets)

| Document | Line | Display Text | Current Href | Correct Href | Root Cause |
|----------|------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) | 67 | `mods/japan-stage1-summary.md` | `mods/japan-stage1-summary.md` | `mods/japan_reference/japan-stage1-summary.md` | Path changed; link not updated |
| [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) | 68 | `mods/japan-stage2-summary.md` | `mods/japan-stage2-summary.md` | `mods/japan_reference/japan-stage2-summary.md` | Path changed; link not updated |
| [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) | 116 | `mods/japan-stage1-summary.md` | `mods/japan-stage1-summary.md` | `mods/japan_reference/japan-stage1-summary.md` | Duplicate of line 67 issue |
| [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) | 117 | `mods/japan-stage2-summary.md` | `mods/japan-stage2-summary.md` | `mods/japan_reference/japan-stage2-summary.md` | Duplicate of line 68 issue |
| [master-index.md](master-index.md) | ~169 | `mods/japan-stage1-summary.md` | `mods/japan-stage1-summary.md` | `mods/japan_reference/japan-stage1-summary.md` | Path changed; link not updated |

**Verification method:** Tested with `file_search` and `read_file` tools; files exist only at `reference/mods/japan_reference/` not `reference/mods/` root.

## Appendix: Metrics Consistency Check

All major statistical claims verified across documents.

| Metric | INDEX.md | data-index.md | extraction-workflow.md | Status |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| Total functions | 8,989 | — | 532 .scar files | ✓ Consistent |
| SCAR API functions | 4,435 | — | — | ✓ Cited in INDEX |
| Global variables | 14,158 | 14,158 | ~14,000 | ✓ Consistent |
| Squad/Entity groups | 3,214 | 3,214 | ~3,200 | ✓ Consistent |
| Unique objectives | 835 | 835 | — | ✓ Consistent |
| Module imports | 453 | 453 | — | ✓ Consistent |
| Campaign scenarios | 394 | — | 394 | ✓ Consistent |
| Gameplay scripts | 138 | — | 138 | ✓ Consistent |
| Campaign missions | 65 | — | — | ✓ Verified (9+11+13+8+9+8+1+6) |

**Conclusion:** All numeric metrics are synchronized across documents. Timestamp conflict (Feb 23 vs 24) does *not* affect data accuracy, only metadata labeling.

## Appendix: Directory Structure Verification

**Reference folder subdirectories (expected vs. actual):**

| Folder | Expected? | Exists? | Files |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------|
| `blueprints/` | ✓ | ✓ | 15 files (campaign scenario blueprints) |
| `campaigns/` | ✓ | ✓ | Contains 7 subfolders (abbasid, angevin, challenges, etc.) |
| `gameplay/` | ✓ | ✓ | System indexes (AI, objectives, etc.) |
| `systems/` | ✓ | ✓ | Cross-cutting system documentation |
| `dumps/` | ✓ | ✓ | Raw extraction outputs and batch manifests |
| `mods/` | ✓ | ✓ | Contains: MOD-INDEX.md, arabia-mod-index.md, japan_reference/ |
| `mods/japan_reference/` | ✓ | ✓ | 10 Japan scenario reference files |
| `.skill/` | ✓ | ✓ | AI reference generation tools (node_modules) |

**Verification:** All subdirectories mentioned in [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) section "📁 Advanced: Subdirectories" are present and populated.

## Appendix: Policy Compliance Check

### "Always use reference copy" Rule

**Rule statement (from INDEX.md line 121):**
```
Always use the reference copy (`reference/mods/MOD-INDEX.md`) for Copilot lookups. 
Never read `mods/Japan/MOD-INDEX.md` directly (Mods Folder Scope restriction).
```

**Compliance finding:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL VIOLATION**

- ✓ Policy is stated in both [INDEX.md](INDEX.md) and [mods/MOD-INDEX.md](mods/MOD-INDEX.md)
- ✓ `reference/mods/` exists with proper cross-reference files
- ✗ Broken links in INDEX.md mean users cannot navigate to recommended reference files
- ✗ The broken links point to paths that *don't* clarify they're in `japan_reference/` subfolder

**Impact:** A user following INDEX.md's broken links would:
1. Fail to find the file
2. Search manually, potentially stumbling into `mods/Japan/` directly
3. Violate the "never read mods/ directly" policy by accident

**Root cause:** Links were not updated when files were moved into the `japan_reference/` subfolder.

## Summary of Findings

| Category | Count | Severity |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Broken links | 4 | ~~CRITICAL~~ RESOLVED |
| Timestamp conflicts | 1 | HIGH (cosmetic) |
| Metadata gaps | 4 | MEDIUM |
| Redundant sections | 1 | MEDIUM |
| Token efficiency issues | 2 | LOW |
| **Total issues** | **12** | — |

### Recommended Fix Priority

1. **IMMEDIATE (blocking usability):** Fix all 4 broken links in INDEX.md and master-index.md
2. **HIGH (blocking confidence):** Resolve timestamp conflict in INDEX.md
3. **MEDIUM (clarity improvement):** Consolidate Mods sections and add authority markers to 4 key files
4. **OPTIONAL (future optimization):** Split large CSV files for better token efficiency

**Estimated Fix Time:** ~15 minutes for critical fixes; ~45 minutes if including structural improvements.
